# Predictive Modeling for Safe Driving - README

## Overview

Welcome to the Predictive Modeling for Safe Driving project! In this data science endeavor, our primary objective is to leverage the advancements in technology and statistical libraries to predict the binary outcome of whether a driver is safe (1) or needs a review (0). We aim to enhance the efficiency of insurance companies by utilizing data science tools to analyze premium and claim data, with a particular focus on identifying potentially fraudulent transactions.

## Technologies and Tools

- **Data Science Libraries**: Utilizing popular statistical libraries for regression and classification tasks.
- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: Essential tools for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Employing machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data by imputing mean or median values.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying and managing highly correlated features to avoid skewing results.

## Data Preparation

### 1. Parsing and Categorization

- Handling ordinal and categorical data by parsing and categorizing them appropriately.
  
### 2. Missing Data Handling

- Filling in missing data in continuous variables using mean or median to maintain result integrity.

## Predictive Modeling

### 1. Binary Outcome Prediction

- Using machine learning algorithms to predict a binary outcome:
  - 1: Safe Driver
  - 0: Driver Data Needs Review

### 2. Feature Correlation Analysis

- Exploring the correlation among features to identify and drop highly correlated data that may impact the accuracy of predictions.
